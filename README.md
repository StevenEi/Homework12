# Homework 12 - Employee Tracker DB

## Project Description 
For this project a mock database was created with three tables (employee, role and department) that was then seeded
with mock data. A series of questions were then developed using the Inquirer package and connected to the database using mysql2. These questions allow the user of the CLI to view, manipulate and add on to the seeded data. This 
was meant to replicate a database used at a company to record employee information.
